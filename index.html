    <h1>What is i18n?</h1>
    <p>i18n is an abbreviation for internationalization, a process of designing and developing websites or web applications
      to be adaptable and culturally suitable for users from different countries and language preferences.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h1>Why is i18n required?</h1>
    <p>i18n is required to overcome language and cultural barriers, making your website or web application accessible to a
      global audience. By implementing i18n, you can provide multilingual support, localize content, and adapt to
      regional formats such as date, time, and currency. It enhances user experience and helps to reach a broader user
      base.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h1>When to use i18n?</h1>
    <p>i18n should be considered when you have a target audience that speaks different languages or when you want to
      expand your reach to international markets. It is particularly relevant for e-commerce platforms, content-heavy
      websites, and any application that aims to cater to users from diverse linguistic backgrounds.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h1>How i18n impacts our website or web apps?</h1>
    <p>i18n impacts your website or web application by enabling you to provide translated versions of your content,
      localize UI elements, and handle multilingual input and output. It involves the use of language files or databases,
      internationalized templates, and frameworks that facilitate efficient translation management and language-specific
      formatting. With i18n, your website becomes more inclusive and user-friendly for people from different linguistic
      backgrounds.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h1>Where does i18n originate?</h1>
    <p>i18n originated from the need to develop software and systems that can be adapted and used globally. It emerged as
      a result of the increasing interconnectedness of our world, where businesses and individuals seek to bridge
      cultural and linguistic gaps. i18n practices have been adopted across various industries, including software
      development, website localization, and international business.</p>
